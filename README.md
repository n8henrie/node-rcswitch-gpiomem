# node-rcswitch-gpiomem

<http://n8henrie.com/2015/12/control-an-rf-outlet-with-siri-via-homebridge>

Fork of <https://github.com/marvinroger/node-rcswitch> with `/dev/gpiomem`
access for rootless use on Raspbian Jessie as well as an exposing
the `setPulseLength` method and expanding `rcswitch.send` to accept a decimal
RF code (with bit length), as per the c++ version. Renamed as it may not be
backwards compatible with Wheezy / systems without `/dev/gpiomem`.

My contribution has been negligible; all credit goes to the original developers
of these libraries:

- <https://github.com/marvinroger/node-rcswitch>
- <https://github.com/FWeinb/homebridge-rcswitch>
- <https://github.com/32leaves/rcswitch-NodeOnPi>
- <https://github.com/r10r/rcswitch-pi>
- <http://code.google.com/p/rc-switch>
- <https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi>

Additionally, this fork uses
[sched.h](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908775/xsh/sched.h.html) to
try to give the process a high priority during the RF transmission (currently
only implemented for `rcswitch.send()`). I've found this important for
optimizing reliability of the transmission if the CPU is busy. Reference [my
rf_pi post and
repository](http://n8henrie.com/2015/12/rf_pi-control-rf-outlets-from-your-raspberry-pi-without-sudo-or-root/)
for more information on using `libcap2-bin` and `setcap` to accomplish this,
but the short version is: `sudo apt-get install libcap2-bin && sudo setcap
cap_sys_nice+ep $(readlink -f $(which node))`. It works just fine without this
if you don't want to bother or are concerned about the security ramifications.

## Introduction

Node bindings for the rcswitch Raspberry Pi port: <https://github.com/r10r/rcswitch-pi>.

Personally, I have only tested on node v4.2.3. Per original author:

> It should be compatible with Node 0.8, 0.10 and 0.12 (tested only on 0.10 and
> 0.12). Successfully tested on Raspbian Wheezy up-to-date as of 2015-02-28.

## Requirements

- Like the c++ version of rcswitch, [WiringPi must be
  installed](https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/download-and-install/)
  in order to compile.
- To work without root by way of `/dev/gpiomem` part to work, it should be run
  on Raspbian Jessie with [wiringPi >=
  2.29](wiringpi.com/wiringpi-update-to-2-29/)
- Both the data and the power Pins of the 315/433Mhz emitter must be connected
  to the RPi. Note the number of the ~~WiringPi data~~ BCM Pin. (see
  http://wiringpi.com/pins/)

## Usage

```javascript
var rcswitch = require('rcswitch-gpiomem'); // May throw an error if /dev/gpiomem is not accessible
rcswitch.enableTransmit(17); // Use **BCM** pin 17
rcswitch.setPulseLength(190); // Set pulse length (see https://github.com/n8henrie/rf_pi)
rcswitch.setRepeatTransmit(15); // Set number of repeat transmissions
rcswitch.send(12345, 24) // send(code, bitlength)

// Alternative
rcswitch.switchOn("10110", 1); // Switch on the first unit of 10110 (code 1x23x) group
rcswitch.switchOff("11000", 2); // Switch off the second unit of 11000 (code 12xxx) group
```

Note: If testing / experimenting from a local copy of the repo, you need to
require the base directory of the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8henrie/node-rcswitch-gpiomem.git
cd node-rcswitch-gpiomem
npm install .
node
> var rcswitch = require('.')
rcswitch.enableTransmit(17);
```

## API

### Configuration

#### `rcswitch.enableTransmit(int pin)`

Enable transmission on BCM `pin`. On Jessie should "just work". **NB:** if you to **not** want to use `/dev/gpiomem`, you'll need to first export the pin with the wiringPi `gpio` utility to avoid needing root.`

- `pin` - (Number) data Pin to use following [the WiringPi schema](http://wiringpi.com/pins/)

Return true if `pin` is an integer, false otherwise.

#### `rcswitch.disableTransmit()`

Disable transmission (set the pin to -1 which disable any following function call).

Return true.

#### `rcswitch.setPulseLength(int pLength)`

- `pLength` - RF pulse length, defaults to 190.
- See: <http://n8henrie.com/2015/12/rf_pi>

#### `rcswitch.setRepeatTransmit(int nRepeat)`

- `nRepeat` - Number of repeat transmissions (default 10)

#### `rcswitch.send(int code, int bLength)`

- `code` - **decimal** RF code to send
- `bLength` - bit length of decimal RF code
- See: <http://n8henrie.com/2015/12/rf_pi>

Return true if both are Uint32, otherwise false.

#### `rcswitch.send(`char* codeWord`)`

- `codeWord` - (String) codeword. Can use this to send the **binary** RF code,
see: <http://n8henrie.com/2015/12/rf_pi>

Return true.

## Specific RF receiver types

This is for use with specific RF protocols that I have never needed -- I just
use [RF_Snifer](https://github.com/n8henrie/rf_pi) to get the code. -@n8henrie

## FAQ / Troubleshooting

It seems that the `gpiomem` system I use and the SysFS method of interacting with the GPIO are not compatible for reasons [explained in this issue](https://github.com/n8henrie/homebridge-rcswitch-gpiomem/issues/11). Make sure that you aren't also using programs that access the GPIO by way of SysFS or this library may not work.
